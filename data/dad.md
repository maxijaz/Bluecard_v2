Absolutely â€” hereâ€™s the revised version with a gentler, more strategic tone that offers the summary and recommendation (without committing yet), and subtly invites agreement on extending the course and recognising the value of CAT4 prep:

**Subject: Quick Update â€“ CAT4 Preparation Options**

Dear \[Dadâ€™s Name],

Following on from the information I shared earlier about the CAT4 test, Iâ€™ve been looking more closely at the best ways we can support Amy and Cleverâ€™s preparation. As we know, CAT4 is quite a specialised test â€” and most proper preparation materials are delivered **online-only**, with limited access windows and digital restrictions. I sent you information about **TestPrep-Online**, which sells CAT4 practice packages with full tests and guides. Prices start around **69 US dollars** â€“ this is an online class designed for self-study:

Teacher packs that include printable resources usually come as part of premium education packages, which can be quite expensive. A more practical route may be using **downloadable PDF-based practice packs** from trusted providers, which can be printed locally and used flexibly in our lessons. I'm happy to fully research this option today and share what I find.

If it sounds good to you, Iâ€™d be glad to prepare a full summary and recommendation so we can explore how best to move forward for Amy and Clever. Of course, with the course currently set to finish on **13 June**, it may be worth considering an extension â€” especially if we shift into more targeted CAT4 support. Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts before I make any final plans.

Warm regards,
Paul
