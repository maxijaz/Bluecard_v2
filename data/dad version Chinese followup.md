Just a gentle reminder — I noticed you haven’t responded yet about the CAT4 preparation. That’s absolutely fine, I understand you may be busy, and I’m happy to wait.

Before we decide what to do next, I’d like to suggest we pause classes today, Saturday, and Sunday. This way, we can save the remaining class time while we take time to plan for CAT4. There will be no charge for these three days.

A short break can also help the children rest and recharge. Amy and Clever have been working very hard for over a year now — around 10 hours each week — and I really admire their effort. A little time off now might be good for them before we start something new.

Thank you so much for your support. Please let me know your thoughts — I’ll follow your lead.
