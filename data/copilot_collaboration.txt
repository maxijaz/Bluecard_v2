Based on your workspace and project outline, here’s a prioritized plan to guide your development:

1. Core Data Management
Why?
The entire application relies on accurate and reliable data handling. Ensuring the data layer is robust will prevent issues in the UI and other components.

Tasks:
Enhance Validation:
Update parser.validate_class_format() to validate nested structures (e.g., metadata, students).
Ensure required fields like Company, Teacher, StartDate, etc., are present and correctly formatted.
Error Handling:
Add error handling for file I/O operations in parser.load_data() and parser.save_data() (e.g., missing or corrupted JSON files).
Log errors to bluecard_errors.log.
Unit Tests:
Write tests for parser.py to ensure data loading, saving, validation, and backup logic work as expected.
2. Launcher Form
Why?
The Launcher is the entry point for the application and sets the tone for the user experience. It also connects to other forms like Mainform, Metadata Editor, and Archive Manager.

Tasks:
Implement the Launcher form with:
A table displaying class data (Class No, Company, Archive).
Buttons for actions like Open, Edit, Add New Class, Archive, etc.
Connect the Launcher to the data layer (parser.load_data()).
Add logic for button actions:
Open → Load the selected class in Mainform.
Edit → Open Metadata Editor for the selected class.
Add New Class → Open Metadata Editor with a blank form.
Archive → Mark the selected class as archived.
3. Mainform
Why?
The Mainform is the core interface for managing class and student data. It provides the most functionality and will be heavily used.

Tasks:
Implement the Mainform layout as described in the outline.
Display metadata (e.g., Company, Teacher, StartDate) and the attendance table.
Add button logic:
Add Student → Open the Student Editor form to add a new student.
Edit Student → Open the Student Editor form to edit the selected student.
Remove Student → Mark the selected student as inactive.
Manage Students → Open the Student Active Manager.
Connect the Mainform to the data layer for loading and saving class data.
4. Metadata and Student Editors
Why?
These forms allow users to add or edit critical data. They are essential for maintaining accurate class and student records.

Tasks:
Implement the Metadata Editor:
Allow editing of fields like Company, Teacher, StartDate, etc.
Save changes back to the JSON file.
Implement the Student Editor:
Allow adding or editing student details (e.g., Name, Score, Attendance).
Save changes back to the JSON file.
5. Archive Manager
Why?
Archiving and restoring classes is a key feature for managing historical data.

Tasks:
Implement the Archive Manager form.
Display archived classes and provide options to restore or delete them.
Connect the Archive Manager to the data layer.
6. Themes and Settings
Why?
Themes improve the user experience, and settings allow customization.

Tasks:
Implement theme switching based on themes.json.
Create a basic settings form to select themes.
7. Final Touches
Why?
Polishing the application ensures a smooth user experience.

Tasks:
Add error messages and confirmations (e.g., "Are you sure you want to delete this student?").
Test the entire application for bugs and edge cases.
Package the app as a .exe using PyInstaller.
